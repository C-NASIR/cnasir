        Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you
        didnâ€™t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail
        away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore.
        Dream. Discover. (Mark Twain)

        I am a software engineer from Wisconsin. I love reading books, debating
        philosophical topics, getting deep into technical aspects of problems,
        and working with others to achieve collective goals.
